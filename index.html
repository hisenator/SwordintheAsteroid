 <h1 style= "font-size:100px;"> Sword in the Asteroid </h1>



<p style= "text-align:left;">
In the far future, Earth has joined the great many civilizations of the universe, and has achieved the final frontier.
On this desolate moon, in the outerspace highway, is a pit stop where many ships rest and refuel. Here the starliner
the <span style="color:#FF4ECA"> Infinity </span> hangs in the view of pink <span style="color:#FF4ECA"> Crystal Moon. </span> We are aboard the ship of an adventurer
and explorer, searching for a <span style="color:#FF4ECA"> sword </span> lodged in the ground.

<h1 span style="color:#4E9CFF"> Artist Statement </h1> </span>
<p span style="color:#BD208E">This 3D scene is inspired by my space opera rom-com idea I had when I was younger.
  <br><br>I  wanted to create a
  scene that lets you see the place within it, in a space that is explorable. While I wanted it to be a "fly through space"
  sort of feel, I couldnt get it too look as good as invisioned.
  <br> <br>Using the demo floor I instead made this asterorid type surface, and  decided to add the story idea's
namesake to the scene. I created the look by messing with the colors of the lights, background and adjusting the gravity of the movement and jumping.   <p>
